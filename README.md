This is one of a few python exercises I did as a Purwadhika Data Science and Machine Learning course student. In this exercise, I practiced extracting data using a website's REST API.
This particular [Pokemon website](https://pokeapi.co/) provided data of Pokemons and their abilities that we can freely use without any hits limitations. <\br>

We can input the name of any Pokemon in the search box and the website will provide us with its data in a JSON format. You could also use the API address and run it using the **Postman App**.

The end goal of this exercise is to make a simple interactive interface using **Python**. The user can input the name of any Pokemon and they will be able to see its stats, type, abilities, complete with the link to its image.
If the user inputs a name of a Pokemon that does not exist, they will receive an error message.

You can see the full code I made in the **PokemonAPI** file.
